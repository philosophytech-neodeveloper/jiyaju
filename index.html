                        Jiyaju-Eco is a health-centred, people-focused sanitizing/disinfecting service, delivering a turnkey business solution that is innovative, inclusive, and engaging. In a world <br> where hygiene is often neglected, our mission is
                        to eradicate the spread of germs and diseases and to avoid bacteria from penetrating from one person to the next. We have <br> dedicated ourselves to educating and start the conversation of health around public domain surfaces
                        such as Automatic Teller Machines (ATM’s); bathroom entrance/exits; <br> mall entrances/exits; airports; elevator buttons; escalators; hospital entrances/exits; digital pay point machines and various biometric mechanisms. We plan
                        to place our <br> Jiyaju-Eco sanitizers/disinfectant machines in and around these areas to mitigate infection and promote hygiene.

                        Such areas where high volumes of people are in contact with each other, pose a great threat to human lives as they are possible hosts to microbial organisms and germs <br> that cause sickness and infection and can possibly start
                        a pandemic like the Coronavirus if proper hygiene and sanitation measures are not followed.
